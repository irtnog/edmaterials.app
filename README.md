## Development Environment

1. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), e.g., on Debian, run `apt-get install -y jekyll ruby-dev build-essential`.

2. In a local clone of this repository, run `bundle config set path .rubygems && bundle install`.  This will install everything you need to run GitHub Pages locally.

3. Still in the same working directory as above, start a local web server by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
